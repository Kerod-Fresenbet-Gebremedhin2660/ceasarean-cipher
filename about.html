            </h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift,
                is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each
                letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A,
                E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who, according to Suetonius, used it with a shift of three (A becoming D when encrypting, and D becoming A when decrypting) to protect messages of military significance. While Caesar's was the first recorded use of this scheme, other substitution ciphers are known to have been used earlier.

                How to break the Caesar Cipher
            </h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                A cipher uses a "key" to disguise plaintext to make it unreadable. The Caesar shift cipher is one of the simplest and best-known methods of encryption.
                It’s also the best first assumption when encountering a code. Knowledge of the frequency of letters and common placements of vowels helps break a more complicated code, not to mention the assumptions that should follow the frequency of the word t-h-e and the assumption that a single letter is probably “a” but not many code makers will give that letter up so easily.
                The Caesar cipher can be easily broken even in a cipher text-only scenario. Two situations can be considered:
                <br><br><br><strong>1.</strong> An attacker knows (or guesses) that some sort of simple substitution cipher has been used, but not specifically that it is a Caesar scheme.</li>
                <br><strong>2.</strong> An attacker knows that a Caesar cipher is in use, but does not know the shift value.

                How to break the Caesar Cipher
            </h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                In the first case, the cipher can be broken using the same techniques as for a general simple substitution cipher, such as frequency analysis or pattern words.[16] While solving, it is likely that an attacker will quickly notice the regularity in the solution and deduce that a Caesar cipher is the specific algorithm employed.
                The distribution of letters in a typical sample of English language text has a distinctive and predictable shape. A Caesar shift "rotates" this distribution, and it is possible to determine the shift by examining the resultant frequency graph.
                In the second instance, breaking the scheme is even more straightforward. Since there are only a limited number of possible shifts (25 in English), they can each be tested in turn in a brute force attack.
